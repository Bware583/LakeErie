# First User - Jeanette Schnars
The user is a scientist. She wants to use the tool to communicate weather trends to other scientists. She needs a
clear and concise dashboard to define historical trends on different timescales. Strong technical background, 
but in biology, not software design.

# Second User - Boaters/Fishermen
The second set of users encompasses fishermen and boaters. They want data that is relevant to the data that they're doing. 
They want it now, they want it to be accurate, and they want it to be understandable. It cannot be assumed that the 
users of this group have any type of technical background at all.

# Third User - Sofware Engineer
This is the next user to integrate with the software. They are interested in upgrading the software to another version, 
such as adding in other parameters to analyze. They want to be able to understand the code and add parameters as 
seamlessly as possible. They may have very minimal software development experience, but they should know the basics.
